# Pneumonia Detection using chest X-ray images

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable.

 **Motivation:** To build an automated system to detect and classify human diseases(Pneumonia) from medical images.
## Approach
Used transfer learning techniques to develop an artificial intelligence system.
### Key Technologies used
* Python
* Tensorflow
* Google Colab GPU
* TensorBoard
* Resnet architectures
## The Dataset

**Achievement:** Accurately distinguished bacterial and viral pneumonia on chest X-rays and serves as a prototype for application in biomedical imaging.
